    <div id="introduction">
      <p>Jääß (Jess de Jesus) is a visual artist coming from France and currently based in Berlin. She is also a researcher in philosophy of technology at the <a href="https://www.tu-berlin.de/menue/home/parameter/en/" target="_blank">Technical University of Berlin</a>.</p>
      <p>Jääß (Jess de Jesus) is a <strong>digital / (live) visual artist</strong> and a research associate in Philosophy of Technology based in Berlin. Her fields of research intersect with the recurring themes of her artistic production; <em>Digital Culture</em>, <em>Technofuture(s)</em>, <em>Xenofeminism</em>, <em>Queer Identity</em>, <em>Hacktivism</em>, <em>Surveillance</em>, <em>Technospirituality</em>, <em>AI</em> and <em>Machine Thought</em>.
      <br>
      Through her different contribution, from digital art to live visual performances, she focuses on the new social paradigms brought by the techno-capitalist society. She blends influences from different contexts – from alien phenomenology to machine metaphysics. Dystopias and dark futures are the leitmotivs of her work, but mostly using the language of cinematographic, sometimes abstract and colourful, chaos.</p>
